hi i'll share with you my first challenge in the terminal on linux (if you have exercice to share i'll take it!)

to begin i asked chatgpt to give me challenge in connection with [Linux Fundamentals PART1](https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxfundamentalspart1). 

Here is what exercice he give me : 
Challenge 1: Navigation

Create a folder `lab1`.
Enter it.
Create three subfolders: `docs`, `images`, `scripts`.
Verify with `tree` (or `ls -R`).

---

Challenge 2: Simple files

Inside `docs`, create a file `notes.txt`.
Put the sentence `Linux test` into it using `echo`.
Read the content with `cat`.

CHALLENGE 1 : 

There is 10 challenge in total but i just do these 2 because i had somethings elses to do. But to stay on the topic here what i started for 
1 : i opened one of myt vm's wich was ubuntu (really like it) and start open the terminal with crtl + alt + T 
2 : then i created the folder on my desktop so i first of all do "cd Desktop" and after i was on my desktop i created the directory lab1 with the command "mkdir lab1"
3 : to enter it i simply do "cd lab1"
4 : and to create these three sub folder i first of all inside lab1 "mkdir docs && mkdir images && mkdir scripts" but after checking the anwser i realized it was simpler than that by just writing "mkdir docs images scripts"..
5 : i verified and everything was like i wanted to i go to challenge 2!

CHALLENGE 2 : 

1 : because i concatenate them i just go in docs by doing "cd docs" but if you had to do it another you could do it by write all the commande like "cd /home/user/desktop/and so on.." or 1 by 1 like "cd user, then cd desktop.. and so on"
2 : to create the file it was not mentionned inside [Linux Fundamentals PART1](https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxfundamentalspart1) but the command was "touch" so i did "touch notes" 
3 : for the sentence its was simple you had 2 choice ">" or ">>" it's pretty like the same for real in this case because it's a new file. Here is the anwser "echo "Linux test" > or >> notes.txt"
4 : and in last just use "cat" to read the text by doing "cat notes.txt"

That's it for my first summary or writeup i don't know what it is but i take fun doing it really, to finish i just want to thanks the readers of this boring thing and for those who'll help me by giving advice/tips.

Thanks everyone have a good day or sleep, take care of your health, se you next time!
